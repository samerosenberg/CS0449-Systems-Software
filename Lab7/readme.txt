The original freader.c file could access the same global variable from multiple threads which is a huge problem. Since assembly can not load a variable, add 1 and then store it all in one line, while one of those is being done, another thread could try and come in an access that variable causing inconsistencies. If one thread is adding 1 to numthreads and then another interrupts, adds 1 and stores it back, when the first thread resumes, instead of incrementing it again it will just store the same number that is in numthreads currently.
