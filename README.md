CS0449 Intro to System Software

Instructor: Jack Lange

Course Descritpion:
A Computer System is comprised of both hardware and software working in concert to accomplish useful
work. In this course, we will explore the issues of programming a real computer system by examining
the abstractions, interfaces, and design decisions that influence the way that software runs. This
includes the role the Operating System has in communication and resource management.

The perspective we will take is one of the lifecycle of a program from implementation to execution. The
simple act of compiling and running a program, a sequence of events we often take for granted, is a
complex interaction of many different components that work together to manage the computerâ€™s
resources and perform the desired task. Together, these components form a working computer system.
