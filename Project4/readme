1. How to compile:
gcc mallocdrv.c mymalloc.c

2. Tips: 
Do not change malocdrv.c! 
add new type definition (like node in linked list) in mymalloc.c
add function definition you need in mymalloc.h
add function implemetation in mymalloc.c
start testing with a simple test case written by yourself. 

3. What to submit:
(1) mymalloc.h
(2) mymalloc.c
(3) mytest.c
(4) readme, a readme introduce what is your test case and how to test that. 

4. Rubric:
(1) Hand in on time. 10'
(2) test 1 and test 2 in mallocdrv.c (40') 
(3) Pass your own test cass (20')
(4) TA's test case (there is another testdrv only for TA) (10')
(5) No memory errors: so don't have any! run your code under valgrind. (20')
